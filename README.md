# Tracker App

This app was created as a practice to learn the MERN stack un a simple project where you can create a user and then create a log of exercises for each user with some description, duration and date. Also, you can delete or edit each of these logs.

This project is meant to work together with the NodeJS project [traker_app_NodeJS](https://github.com/alejandrotoledoweb/tracker_app_nodejs)

## Built With

- JavaScript
- React

### Linters Used

- Eslint
- Stylelint

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

- Local Machine installed [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn as a package manager
- A code editor as [Visual Studio](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), Sublime,etc.

### Setup

- Please make a local copy of this repo by typing this command on your terminal.

`git clone https://github.com/alejandrotoledoweb/tracker_app_react-redux.git`

- Then, go to the folder created with:

`cd tracker-app-react-redux`

- Install all dependencies

`npm install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
